# AT25 - A cooler RC Car

The goal of this project is to build experience for a potential future in motorsports / Formula Student. As a fan of road car racing, I will be designing the aero and suspension car roughly around the LMGT3 regulations.

### Requirements

Below are the goals of this project. The self-imposed regulations I will be following when designing the car:

- Aerodynamic elements that work and are CFD optimized
- Double Wishbone suspension
- RWD with one sensored brushless motors
- Mostly made of plastic with the exception of:
  - Gearing in the diffs
  - The electronic parts
  - The wheels
  - Any gaskets that may be required
  - Fasteners
- Remote controlled
- Fits a Lego mini figure in a driver seat

### Journal

I will be recording my day to day work in a journal found [here](https://github.com/AdamTuraj/AT25/blob/main/JOURNAL.md)
