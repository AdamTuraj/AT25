# AT25 Journal

This journal will document my findings and progress throughout the project.

## Day 1

Day 1 involved researching and selecting the necessary components. I plan to order most of the parts from GreatHobbies, a Canadian hobby store.

Initially, I selected the battery based on my preferred voltage of 7.4V due to the availability of batteries and motors, and it being at an ideal performance range. For the capacity, I opted for 5000mAh to achieve a decent runtime while remaining cost-effective.

Next, I chose the motor, which required thorough research and consideration. After evaluating the options, I decideed that using a single motor for a RWD setup would offer better cost-effectiveness and performance than 2 motor AWD. The selected motor is a 1406-2280KV, 4-pole sensored model, which can be found in the Bill of Materials (BOM).

Lastly, I selected the tires. Although I originally wanted RC slick tires, the best available option was vintage racing tires. I chose a 26mm width for the front tires and a wider 31mm for the rear.

The BOM can be found at the following link: [AT25 BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1flXe85N5WV3nN8ESYz18NZuvuu6GO_V06G4YLhqS2Ls/edit?usp=sharing)

## Day 2

Today, I began laying out the general design of the car. I began by learning how the aerodynamic elements work and the different elements used. Through this, I got refreshed on Bernoulli's and got a surface level understanding on how the important elements work.

Knowing this, I made a rough sketch on paper as a guideline on how I will design the car. This rough work can be found below.

Finally, I made and found the 3D models for the components I will be using. My plan is to design the aero then determine the packaging for everything else, a similar process used in F1 and other design teams.

Note: I changed the battery to a different, similar spec'd one due to a proprietary connector.
